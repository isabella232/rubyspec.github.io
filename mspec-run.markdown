## mspec-run

Once the [mspec]({{ site.baseurl }}/mspec/) options are processed, the designated target is executed with the remaining options. The general purpose spec runner, `mspec-run`, accepts a file, directory, or shell glob to specify which spec files to execute.

Please run `mspec run -h` to list the available options.
