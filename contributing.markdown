## Contributing to RubySpec

The simplest way to get started writing specs is to fork the main [Github
repo](http://github.com/ruby/spec/), clone the [MSpec
repo](http://github.com/ruby/mspec/), and read the documentation here.
Once you have written a spec and committed it to your fork, send a pull
request.

If you have questions, the quickest response is available in the `#rubyspec`
channel on freenode. Or you can send a message to the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyspec)
