## Contributing to ruby/spec

The simplest way to get started writing specs is to fork the [Github repo](http://github.com/ruby/spec/),
go through the [README](https://github.com/ruby/spec) and read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ruby/spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for further information.
Once you have written a spec and committed it to your fork, send a pull request.

If you have questions, please ask on [our Gitter](https://gitter.im/ruby/spec) or open an issue.
